#Galch Template

Galch Template is a [Bootstrap-based](http://getbootstrap.com), HTML5 BP base template for programming html. Includes lots of goodies, like [Icomoon](http://icomoon.io/), and [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/).

##Features
 - Bootstrap integration
 - Clean HTML5 templates
 - Icomoon Support
 - IE Edge and Chrome Frame (toggleable)
 - HTML5 Boilerplate
 - Grunt script to handle all less and js processing
 - Organized folder structure to support large, scaleable, mantainable themes


## Installation
Pretty easy stuff:

1. **Get the Files** - Download or clone the repository into your workspace directory. 
2. **Install Grunt Requirements** - <code>cd</code> to the theme root and run <code>npm install</code>. This will install all the npm packages that Grunt needs to properly run.

**Notes**: If you have no npm (Node Packaged Modules) go to [npm home page](https://www.npmjs.org/) for setup instructions. Also after installing npm you may need to install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) globally in first place.

## Extension
This project is meant to be a base template for programming adaptive theme on html5/css3. You can take it and build a custom template on it, or use it as a parent theme to your own theme template.
